# nodejs-blog
This is a basic implementation of blog in NODE.js
For running this on your machine mongodb should be installed and run along side. (Also mongodb is implemented for local so to use for different setup change monogodb connection settings.)
Next in command line run- npm install (to install the dependencies)
and then- npm start (to run the website on your local host. )
